Drum-Sheet-Music-Making-Tool
============================

A program to make writing sheet music for the drums easy for beginners. Also allows drummers to recreate sheet music and hear how a certain piece is supposed to sound. It supports up to 4 bars of music, and both 4-4 and 3-4 time signatures. Move along to different bars by pressing the left or right arrow keys or click and drag anywhere on the music staff. You can save or load projects as well. There are still a few bugs related to pausing the music and then scrolling through it and then resuming play as well as a few visual bugs related to using 3/4 time.

NOTE: Works better on MAC rather than WINDOWS

*I did not make nor do I own any of the sprites or backgorunds that I used in the program*
