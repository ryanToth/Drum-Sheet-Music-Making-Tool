Drum-Sheet-Music-Making-Tool
============================

A program to make writing sheet music for the drums easy for beginners. Also allows drummers to recreate sheet music and hear how a certain piece is supposed to sound. It supports up to 4 bars of music, and both 4-4 and 3-4 time signatures. Move along to different bars by pressing the left or right arrow keys or click and drag anywhere on the music staff.

NOTE: Works better on MAC rather than WINDOWS
